Hello! 👋 I'm a developer passionate about programming. In this space, I share my personal projects, open-source contributions, and a bit of my journey in the world of programming. Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch!

## What I Enjoy

Beyond programming, I have a few other passions:

* **Retrogames:** I love revisiting classic games from consoles like Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and Nintendo.
* **Pokémon GBA Games:** Nostalgia hits hard with the Pokémon games on the Game Boy Advance.
* **RPGs:** Immersing myself in rich stories and character development in role-playing games.
* **Reading:** Always eager to learn new things and explore different perspectives through books.
